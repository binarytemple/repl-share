* TODO Appears to be upper limit on broadcast size

  e.g. (range 1000)

  The above will cause an EOF in the watcher.

* TODO Implement watcher side

  Curently I'm taking a funciton set by the user.  It should just be
  (watch share-name).  It should show the shared REPL I/O
  verbatum.

* TODO Interleave watcher REPL

  It would also be great if this output was interleaved with the users
  current REPL session so they can try stuff at their local REPL while
  watching the shared REPL.  That is, I would like for the watch
  function to NOT take over the watcher's REPL.
