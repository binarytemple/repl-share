* TODO Appears to be upper limit on broadcast size

  e.g. (range 1000)

  The above will cause an EOF in the watcher.

* TODO Interleave watcher REPL

  It would also be great if this output was interleaved with the users
  current REPL session so they can try stuff at their local REPL while
  watching the shared REPL.  That is, I would like for the watch
  function to NOT take over the watcher's REPL.
  
* TODO printStackTrace prints nil on watcher side
  Exceptions, in general, don't seem to showup on the watcher side.

* TODO Multiple lines on share side causes EOF

* TODO Send kill signal to watchers
  Sharer needs to send kill signal to watches when closing share.
* TODO How do I test this?
  After futzing with the reader impl multiple times it occured to me I
  need to write some automated tests to expedite the dev process and
  to prevent regressions.
