# repl-share

repl-share is a library the allows you to share your repl with others
across the local network.

The idea for this library came to me during a Clojure meetup.  The
presenter, Russ Olsen, was demonstrating some code at the REPL and I
was having a hard time seeing from the back of the room.  I thought to
myself, "Wouldn't it be nice if he could share his REPL over the wifi
connection?"

## Justifications

1) Why not just allow people to use a read-only VNC?

   This makes the presumption that a VNC server is installed and
   configured correctly.  If not, it's fairly trivial to setup, but
   some people may refuse to have a VNC server on their machine.

2) Why not just stand up an Ajax based web page that polls an embedded
HTTP server?

     This could work but requires either DNS or an IP address to be
     passed around.

There are certainly others ways to share a presentation with many
people in a room.  However, I still think there is a place and time
when you want to easily and instantly share your REPL, and allow
others to watch in their own REPL.
