# repl-share

repl-share is a library the allows you to share your repl with others
across the local network.

The idea for this library came to me during a Clojure meetup.  The
presenter, Russ Olsen, was demonstrating some code at the REPL and I
was having a hard time seeing from the back of the room.  I thought to
myself, "Wouldn't it be nice if he could share his REPL over the wifi
connection?"
