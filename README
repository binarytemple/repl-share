# repl-share

repl-share is a library that allows the easy sharing of a REPL across
the local network.  You simply give repl-share a group name and
anyone on the local network can use repl-share to watch your REPL via
the group name.

The idea for this library came to me during a Clojure meetup.  The
presenter, Russ Olsen, was demonstrating some code at the REPL and I
was having a hard time readin it from the back of the room.  I thought to
myself, "Wouldn't it be nice if he could share his REPL over the wifi
connection?"
